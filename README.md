# Household Energy Consumption Using Machine Learning
Household Energy Usage Forecast:
In the modern era, energy management is crucial for both households and energy providers. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict household energy consumption based on historical data. The insights derived from the model can empower consumers to monitor and optimize their energy usage while enabling energy providers to forecast demand more effectively. The project also serves as a foundation for advanced energy management research.
